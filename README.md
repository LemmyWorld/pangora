## About The Project

Pangora is a forum and link aggregator. You can post links, images, discussions, etc. in various communities and vote and comment on them. However, unlike other link aggregators anyone can easily host their own site running it with the site being federated (where someone using one site is able to interact with content on a second site)

We are downstream from [lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) meaning we pull changes they make into pangora and and try to merge some changes we make upstream to them

> [!warning]
> The project is currently being restructured. Most of the development time is now being spent on sublinks until that can be soft forked into a new version of pangora

## Installation

Not ready for public use yet, use lemmy instead

## Contributing

You can check out the contributing section in the [lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) repository for a guide on how to get started developing for lemmy. For development on pangora, wherever it says to use a lemmy repository, swap it out for the equivalent pangora repository (although note that pangora-ui is completely different from lemmy-ui and will not work on an instance yet)

## Support / Donate

Pangora is a free and open source project. There is currently no way to donate but if you want to help out make sure to check out the contributing section.
