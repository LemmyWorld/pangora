## About The Project

Pangora is a forum and link aggregator. You can post links, images, discussions, etc. in various communities and vote and comment on them. However, unlike other link aggregators anyone can easily host their own site running it with the site being federated (where someone using one site is able to interact with content on a second site)

We are downstream from [lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) meaning we pull changes they make into pangora and and try to merge some changes we make upstream to them
